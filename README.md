Just a few things to keep in mind.

The `useGSAP` hook is designed to integrate the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library into React components, specifically for controlling animations based on scroll triggers and other interactions.

The class `padding-inline` in Tailwind CSS is used to adjust padding on both left and right sides of an element, allowing for responsive designs by specifying different values at various breakpoints, providing necessary breathing space.

The GSAP timeline is a powerful feature that allows developers to chain multiple animations together and synchronize them with scroll events, creating more complex and visually appealing effects that react fluidly to the user's scrolling.
